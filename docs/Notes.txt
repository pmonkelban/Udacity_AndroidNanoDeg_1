- Database Tables:

The following SQLite database tables are used to store artist query results.  This allows the
application to maintain state when stopped, or when the configuration changes (i.e. screen
rotation).  The database also servers as a cache.  Recent results can be pulled from the database,
thus reducing the need to fetch data from the network.  The createTime timestamp provides
a mechanism for keeping the size of the database in check.  On each insert, the application can
delete entries that are older than a specified item.
